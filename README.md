This document entails all the details regarding how the game functions.
This is a two-player board game in which both the players start off with
some initial in-game money and have to roll a dice to move around the board
in a clockwise motion. While doing so each player must buy a property that
they land on, however if a player happens to land on a property that belongs
to the other player, they must pay a rent equivalent to half the value of the
property. There are 4 regions in the game with 2 rows and two columns.
The first row starts off with the start pad, both players are initially
at this point when the game starts and collect $200 dollar in game currency
whenever they pass start. In the same row, following the start pad there are
7 uniquely named properties on which each player can land after rolling the
die with all properties being priced at $10. Moving on to the left column,
there are a total of 7 properties with each being priced at $20 with a jail
on the top left where if a player lands must pay $50. Then comes the top row
and the right column with 7 properties each and a price of $30 and $40,
respectively. The players whose balance goes into negative first loses the game.
